*First define the variables, in this case Z is a varable, and by not specifying it, it's a free range
variables Z;
*Since x cannot be negative, all of these need to be positive
NonNegative Variables x1,x2;
*Then I define the equations
Equations obj,e1,e2,e3;
*Then I need to give value to the equations with =e=, =l=, =g=.
obj..Z=E=-x1-2*x2;
e1..-2*x1+x2=l=2;
e2..-x1+x2=l=3;
e3..x1=l=3;

*The I need to select the model
model FIRSTproblem /ALL/;
solve FIRSTproblem USING LP MINIMIZING Z;
display x1.l,x1.m,x2.m,x2.l;
